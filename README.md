# CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2024, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**, which I took in Spring 2024 at UC Berkeley. The course covers foundational topics in artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning.

## Contents:

- **Projects**: Contains course projects focusing on various aspects of AI, including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, reinforcement learning, and machine learning models.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Search Algorithms**: Implementing uninformed and informed search strategies, such as A*, DFS, BFS, and UCS.
- **Adversarial Search**: Understanding minimax and alpha-beta pruning for game-playing AI.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Working with probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying Q-learning and value iteration to decision-making problems.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing basic supervised learning algorithms and exploring model evaluation techniques.

## How to Navigate:

- **Projects**: All projects are located under the `Projects/` directory, each containing code and documentation on specific AI techniques, such as search algorithms, probabilistic models, and machine learning.
